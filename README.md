## *THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON AMAZON.COM*

## *Problem :*

What is the change in e-commerce sales on amazon.com during the Covid-19 period ?

## *Part of A :*

### Introduction :

In the Covid-19 period, there were changes in people's lifestyle. One of these changes was the
frequency of use of online shopping sites that are already developing steadily. Online
shopping sites were born from the desire of people to shop effortlessly and reach all their
needs from a single platform. However, with the restrictions that came during the pandemic
process, it turned into a mandatory need. Realizing this situation, e-commerce sites became
widespread by expanding their order networks and product range.
Amazon.com is one of the biggest on the market. I think that I can reach enough data to
examine the effects of this period on e-commerce companies.

### The Story of Problem :

For us born in generations Y and z, internet is a basic need found at every stage of our lives
and sometimes a tool by which we can obtain our basic needs.
As someone who uses online shopping sites actively in the pre-pandemic period, my personal
use has increased during the pandemic period. In addition, from the beginning of this period, I
had the opportunity to work in every department of a small-scale e-commerce company and
closely examine the changes in this company for about a year. These changes are mostly
positive. So how were the larger companies affected, or how far were the market providers of
this area affected? Is it completely positive in effect? Probably yes, but I hope that by
visualizing the answers to these questions, I will be able to learn the real effect more clearly
and present it to the curious.

### Information About Data :

Amazon publishes its sales data every three months from its website. I will use the
information on net sales, operating earnings, operating expenses, total income and diluted
earnings per share to see which way the company is affected from these data. I plan to use the
data of the pre-pandemic and in-process years to clearly examine the difference.

## *Tools :*

I will use Python's matplotlib library for data visualization.
